# Logseq2Obsidian

This is a simple Python script to convert Logseq markdown to syntax that looks also good in Obsidian.

I love using Logseq to take note. But I am a bit not satisfied (I am greedy ðŸ˜Ž) when Obsidian has very fluent mobile experience and a cool graph view. So, I want both ðŸ˜™. This script lets me take notes in Logseq and easily convert them for Obsidian. That way, I can check my notes on my phone or enjoy the graph view whenever I want ðŸ˜†. 

## How to run
```
python batch_convert.py --file_path graph --dest_path obsidian_vault
```

Flags:
- `--file_path`: Path to the Logseq notes directory to process. (The script will not change anything in this directory.)
- `--dest_path`: Path to the destination directory. (If this directory exists, the script will delete it and create a new one.)

Your Logseq notes directory will be like this:
```plaintext
graph/
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notes.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ journals/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2024_08_08.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ image.png
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- The `pages` and `journals` directories contain markdown files to be converted.
- The `assets` directory, along with its contents, will be copied to the destination without changes.

> [!Note] This script is experimental and may not work for all cases. 
> Please backup your files before running this script.
> The script will delete existing content in the destination directory.

## Conversion Process
For each .md in `pages`, `journals`, the script:

1. Processes the properties in the beginning of the file
2. Removes the leading '-', indentation but preserving code block indentation
3. Converts or delete special syntax
    It caters to the following syntax:
    - Convert special syntax:
        - `![image.jpg](image.jpg){:height 300, :width 600}` to `![image.jpg|600](image.jpg)`
        - `{{cloze XXX}}` to `XXX`
        - `DONE` to `- [X]`
        - `TODO` to `- [ ]`
    - Deletes syntax that is not used in Obsidian:
        - collapsed:: true
        - logseq.order-list-type:: number
        - background-color:: XXX
        - card-last-score:: XXX
        - card-repeats:: XXX
        - card-next-schedule:: XXX
        - card-last-interval:: XXX
        - card-ease-factor:: XXX
        - card-last-reviewed:: XXX
    - Converts syntax of callouts
